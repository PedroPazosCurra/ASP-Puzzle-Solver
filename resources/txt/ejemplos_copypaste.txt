    There are three houses. In them live a spanish, an english and a chinese. The spanish man house is painted red, while the englishman house is tainted blue. The house of the chinese is purple. A dog lives in the red house. The chinese loves to drink beer. The spanish, on the other hand, smokes Ducados.
    In my Einstein puzzle, there are five houses. The English lives in the Red house. The Spaniard owns the Dog. Coffee is drunk in the Green house. The ukranian drinks Tea. The green House is immediately to the right of the Ivory house. The Gold smoker owns Snails. Kools are smoked in the Yellow house. Milk is drunk in the middle house. The norwegian lives in the first house. The man who smokes Chesterfields lives in the house next to the man with the Fox. Kools are smoked in the house where the Horse is kept. The Strike smoker drinks Orange juice. The Japanese smokes parliaments. The Norwegian lives next to the Blue house.
